Viral gene products that modulate the cellular antiviral immune response targets of such viral proteins are often not known. We performed a functional proteomic approach to identify cellular binding partners of viral innate immune modulators. We used a Tet-on system to express such viral proteins in HEK293 cells and isolated protein complexes by tandem affinity purification. Altogether, we used 70 viral proteins (from 30 viruses) resulting in identification of 579 unique host proteins. These protein
complexes were analysed by mass spectrometry (MS) and integrated into a protein interaction map for deep bioinformatic and network analysis. Selected number of candidates were further functionally validated.
